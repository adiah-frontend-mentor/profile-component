## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

I created a react app using `create-react-app`. Since there was only a single component for this project I placed it
directly into the `App.js` file.

I wrote standard html markup first, then added styles using `sass`. I used a breakpoint mixin to add responsiveness.

Once it displayed correctly, I refactored it as a React component, passing in prop data to make it reusable.
